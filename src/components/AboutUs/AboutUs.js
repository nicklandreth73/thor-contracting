            At Thor Contracting we care about helping people complete their
            dream projects. When a customer sees their abandoned space become
            the most beautiful part of their home our dreams are realized as
            well.

            Through thirty years of construction experience our owner John
            Thoreson has learned to take on all types of projects big and small.
            But seeing customers' dreams realized in improving their own homes
            has always been where he has found the most rewarding.
            <br />
